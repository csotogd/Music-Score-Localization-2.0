# Music-Score-Localization-2.0
The absence of an automatic page turner that can
localise a musician performing to the appropriate section of
a music score poses problems. Particularly for musicians with
visual impairments who must zoom into the sheet music to
distinguish notes, greatly increasing the frequency of page turns.
The paper proposes a novel adaptation of the Shazam algorithm
combined with Monte Carlo localisation to solve the music score
localisation problem and account for repetition disambiguation
